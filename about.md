# About

My Favorite Book I've read is *Pendragon The Merchant of Death* It's about a kid who figures out he's a "traveler" which allows him to take gates to get to other dimensions and essentially solve their problems while figuring himself out and his traveling powers. There's a lot more to it however I don't want to ~~ruin~~ spoil it for you.
Favorite thing to do is to snowboard! I love snowboarding with a passion I would spend every hour of every day doing it if I could.
Favorite animal is a [Polar Bear](https://i.insider.com/5e4c641b69692c00533ecf1b?width=1100&format=jpeg&auto=webp) How can you not love these animals?
