# Fun Facts
* Listen, I don't really like this app, It's a social media app where you can post videos. I posted <b>one</b> video and it went viral. 14.5 Million views and 2.5 Million likes on that app alone I saw it being reposted on a few different wesbsites with no credit given however!
* Fun fact! I wrote this whole project in html because I was naive and thought github would magically create this into a website. Upon further reading I figured it all out!
* Small story, however when I was 8-9 years old in 2009 I was recorded to be in a movie! I was even given my own IMDB page that states that I'm known for my role in that movie. Called How I Got Lost. I didn't have a speaking part but it's fun to know that I'm listed in the cast and was craeted an IMDB page.
