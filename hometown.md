# Hometown
I grew up in Kirkwood Missouri, a moderately small town near Saint Louis. I worked at car wash in my town called Waterway where I became a Team Leader. We had other car washes around. Some in Colorado, Kansas City, etc. My family recently moved north to Hazelwood where we got a way bigger plot of land. Kirkwood is an amazing place though where I met all my friends which some of them followed me here to Mizzou! I spent most of my time at school and then right after would hed straight to Hidden valley where I would snowboard. If I wasn't snowboaridng I was working. Now I live in Columbia where I spend my time going to school. On Fridays however Hidden Valley runs a discount where college students go for half off. Theres a lot my hometown and highschool taught me and set me up for sucess pretty well. Kirkwood was an ideal place to grow up for me!
