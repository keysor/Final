# Fun Facts
Small story, however when I was 8-9 years old in 2009 I was recorded to be in a movie! I was even given my own IMDB page that states that I'm known for my role in that movie. Called How I Got Lost. I didn't have a speaking part but it's fun to know that I'm listed in the cast and was craeted an IMDB page
